V3 - reduced timing due to severe knock.  

Work - Removed IC and zip tyed blue tee, checked for other leaks. Tried to fix suspension klunk after alignment.  Thinking it might be giving false knock. Seems to have helped a little. 

Testing - Logs seem cleaner for a few pulls.  Then filled up with shell 93 ultra. More clean logs minus some lower load knock.


V4- Added timing back removed in V3. Changed Primary OL fueling in 3200 and 3600; .06-1.15 loads. Dropped by AFR by .5. Changed base timing in 3200 and 3600 rows @ .59-.76 loads by ~2. Blending the peak.

testing - LV showing knock in low rpm, low load.  

More driving with v4 tune.  Getting loads of timing removed (11.7) in the low load/rpm range (up to 2100rpm and .95 load)

V5 - pulled timing from 1600 - 2400 rpm in the .25-.93 loads.  Also pulled .5 timing from 700/800 rpm 1.10/1.27 load cells

V5-old - old v5, not tested yet. Replaced with new v5 for testing. removed some timing from 2000 and 2400 rpm range .42 - 1.10 loads. May just need to add fuel instead as I might be spooling faster than the base stage 2 rom from headers and uppipe.  Need to log to confirm.

V6 - changed rough correction range (load) for knock control to not effect IAM on loads below 1.8/1.75

V7 - still getting low rpm/load knock. Not sure if false or not. Still need to get new endlinks. Experiencing lurching at 2000-2400 rpms in really low loads and only at slight throttle openings.  After some research going to try adding 10% to throttle tip in enrichment table.
